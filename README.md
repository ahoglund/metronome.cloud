## TODO:

1. Maybe beat type a drop down with fixed values.
2. Make a display grid that allows you to customize accented subdivisions.
3. Add a polyrhythm feature.
4. Practice mode: You can schedule a set of bars and rest with incremental tempo increases.
5. Play tones for tuning or practicing with. Start with simple sine waves?
